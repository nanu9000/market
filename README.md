# Stock market dApp

## Summary
This is a fairly basic dApp that I spun up to learn solidity and smart contract infrastructure.

## Project Milestones
- ~~Track buy/sell orders~~
- ~~Execute trades when possible (e.g. a buy offer > a sell offer)~~
- ~~Add accounts that track money and stock inventory~~
- Create a UI
- Add default expirations to the offers (1 min). Buys will send the money back, sells will remove the bid from the offer list.
